# A Simple Ruby Twitter Client

## The Problem

You want a Ruby library that allows you to:

1. view tweets for a given Twitter handle
2. tweet from your Twitter handle

For some reason, you also decide that you want to write this library yourself.


## Solution

Implement your solution as:

1. `Twitter::User#tweets`
2. `Twitter::Me#tweet(tweet)`


## Testing

Test your solution is correct with:

```
$ gem install minitest

$ ruby test_twitter.rb
```
